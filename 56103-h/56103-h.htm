        PREFACE.
      </h2>
    </div>
    <hr class="c009" />
    <p class="c010">
      <span class="sc">To</span> what trifles do some men owe a perpetuation of
      their "<i>famous memory</i>." There is Nimrod, for instance, not but what
      he may have had other and <i>greater</i> merits, yet he is best known as a
      "<i>mighty hunter</i>," and one who "wore <i>boots</i>;" now, allowing the
      relation to be true, and that he <i>did</i> hunt, and he <i>did</i> wear
      boots, is there anything extraordinary attaching to either, unless indeed,
      it could be proved that he had <i>wooden legs</i>, or that he was capable
      of sitting on the backs of two or more animals at one time; and if such
      were not the case, the simple fact of itself was never worth recording; as
      well may it be said, a thousand years hence, that LLOYD <i>was a great
      Hatmaker, and lived in a great City</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      But possibly the hunting system of this <i>old gentleman</i> differed
      materially from the pastime of our modern <i>Tally-ho's</i>, and instead
      of running after <i>hares</i>, <i>snipes</i>, and <i>conies</i>, Nimrod's
      sport was on the <i>field of battle</i>; in whose days the most rational
      idea is, that all was <i>game</i> which caused pursuits, and all pursuits
      <i>hunting</i>: If it were not so, and his majesty's capability only
      extended to the <i>riding</i> upon a <i>horse's back</i>, there is not a
      butcher's boy, in any country village between <span class="sc">Berwick</span>
      and <span class="sc">St. Ives</span>, that would not have ridden Nimrod's
      <i>rump</i> off. But it may be asked by those whose inclinations and
      patience shall lead them to hunt through the following pages, whether this
      is what it professes to be, a <span class="sc">Preface</span>, which is
      supposed to explain, or prepare the mind for something to come; the answer
      to which is as follows: A horse that will not <i>go</i> without another
      being led before him, is not worth <i>riding</i>, and if what is herein
      written requires a Preface to render it <i>intelligible</i>, it is not
      worth the <i>reading</i>.

        JOHN BULL.
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c013">
      <span class="sc">The</span> greatest difficulty a painter has
      professionally to encounter is to produce a striking resemblance of a
      countenance where there are no striking features: just so with the Hat
      called "<span class="sc">John Bull</span>." It has no marked style of
      peculiarity in the formation; but, independent of the <i>fine texture</i>,
      there is in it a combination of rare qualities not often met with: for
      instance-it has in appearance strong marks of becoming gravity-a bold but
      manly dignity-a pleasing diffidence, with a conscious, yet unassuming
      importance-and is recommended to persons somewhat robust in form, features
      full and round, with a complexion not too dark. In wearing, it should
      neither be placed aside, thrown too far back, nor brought particularly
      forward over the face, for the following reasons-the first position would
      bespeak an air of <i>non challance</i>-the second a sort of slovenly
      neglect in the person-and the third an incommunicative sullenness of
      disposition.
    </p>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h2 class="c014">
        THE WELLINGTON.
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c013">
      <span class="sc">So</span> called from the great Hero; not for the
      popularity of the name alone, but for the reason that such a Hat was
      actually worn by him; and, in fact, it is a shape uncommonly well suited
      both to his face and person; the former being a sort of <i>long oval</i>,
      and the latter without the least appearance of <i>bulk</i>: indeed a
      ponderous body, tall or short, with a round, or what is vulgarly termed a
      pudding face, cannot judiciously shelter itself under a Wellington. This
      Hat is not only particularly <i>becoming</i> the <i>person</i> of his
      Grace, but there is that in its appearance which is strongly
      characteristic of his great mind; for, to an excellently formed crown of
      about seven inches deep, overspreading an inch at top, there is united a
      fine arched brim of small dimensions, taking a smartish sweep of the
      fourth part of a circle, and when placed on the head somewhat <i>a la
      Francais</i>, carries with it an uncommon degree of brilliancy and fire:
      and the fore and hind parts terminating in a close <i>point</i>, clearly
      shows that, whether <i>advancing</i> or <i>retreating</i>, this modern
      <span class="sc">Cæsar</span> is always sure to <i>carry</i> his point.
    </p>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h2 class="c014">
        THE TANDEM.
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c013">
      This is a Hat wherein is displayed a good deal of what may be termed <i>character;</i>
      for which reason, its <i>becoming</i> wearers, comparatively speaking,
      will be few in number; but notwithstanding this <i>marked</i> peculiarity,
      there is a sort of <i>style</i> in its general feature which is uncommonly
      <i>striking;</i> nor is there any form whatever, where so much of that
      airy lightness is to be seen, as in the Tandem. Few persons over <i>thirty</i>
      become this Hat, and none under <i>twenty</i>, and even <i>between</i>
      those ages, if the head be more than twenty-two inches, or less than
      twenty-one and a half in circumference, the whole effect is destroyed.
      Shape of the face immaterial, provided the complexion is not <i>too</i>
      dingy; but, above all things, neither <i>overgrown</i> or little <i>fat</i>
      gentlemen should wear the Tandem. To have the best effect when on the
      head, it should be placed rather forward, inclining a little to one side.
    </p>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h2 class="c014">
        THE TALLY-HO.
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c013">
      A very comfortable and convenient hunting Hat, partaking in some degree
      the natural formation of the head: has many advantages over the old
      fashioned cap; is <i>light</i>, though strong-<i>porous</i>, which allows
      the heat of the head, arising from exertion, to fly off-and <i>elastic</i>,
      the effect of which is to sit close without pressure; but, above all, it
      has a most gentlemanly appearance, which it never fails to communicate to
      the wearer, particularly if he be a true sportsman.
    </p>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h2 class="c014">
        THE SHALLOW.
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c013">
      A Hat more admired for the ease and simplicity of style than for any
      peculiar character in its general appearance; being low in the crown, it
      is worn to most advantage by tall thin gentlemen with very large heads;
      and as the fore and hind part of the brim is <i>set</i> nearly horizontal
      from the base of the crown, it has two great advantages; the first of
      which is, that it may be conveniently worn over a wig; and, secondly, if
      worn <i>without</i>, the shirt collar is kept clean much longer than
      usual. This Hat, to have its proper effect, should be placed on the head
      with a strict <i>formality of set</i>, which in many persons will beget an
      air of <i>importance</i>. N. B. The late Justice Addington generally wore
      a shallow.
    </p>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h2 class="c014">
        THE COBURG.
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c013">
      <span class="sc">For</span> <i>style</i> and <i>form</i> has strong claims
      to favour; but, being rather small in appearance, the wearer, to show to
      most advantage, should be somewhat slender in his make, features not too
      prominent, and in stature about five feet five to five feet ten, but
      neither <i>above</i> nor <i>below</i>. One great advantage attending this
      Hat is, that the shape of the wearer's <i>nose</i> is not at all material,
      provided it be not of that class known by the term "bottled." It may be
      worn a little aside, but by no means placed too far on the head, a failing
      very general among <i>country</i> gentlemen.
    </p>
    <div class="chapter">
      <h2 class="c014">
        THE MARQUIS.
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c013">
      A well-proportioned Hat in every respect, and may, not inaptly, be termed
      the <i>Universal</i>, as it becomes most persons who wear it; in point of
      form, there is nothing of what may be called <i>character</i> or <i>singularity</i>
      in its appearance, and has the rare property of giving to the <i>wearer</i>
      a sort of dignified affability, a courteous condescension, together with
      an agreeable modesty, at least in <i>appearance</i>. It is named after a
      certain nobleman, who has all the above qualities united, although in the
      <i>prime of life</i>. To show to advantage on the head, this Hat should
      not go lower than the tip of the ears, both of which it may barely touch,
      unless the wearer has a short neck, in that case it must be worn somewhat
      aside, touching one ear only, but by no means to be <i>thrown back</i>.

        THE ECCENTRIC.
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c013">
      <i>Unique</i> in its way, strongly embodying the name in its <i>form</i>.
      This Hat is particularly recommended to gentlemen (and many are to be
      found) who hold their understandings libelled by acting, thinking,
      speaking, or dressing like <i>other men</i>; but, it must be observed,
      that slender persons with <i>dark</i> countenances, and about the middle
      size, best become these Hats: for, however eccentric a man would wish to
      appear, by adopting any <i>peculiar</i> mode of dress, he never can hope
      to succeed unless nature has done a <i>little</i> for him; it follows then
      of course, that a tall or short man, if he be stout and well grown, with a
      fine open florid countenance, cannot cleverly become an <i>Eccentric</i>;
      but an <i>agreeable</i> contorsion of the eye, a trifling disagreement in
      the symmetry of the shoulders, or a slight <i>bias</i> of the body <i>right</i>
      or <i>left</i>, are indescribable advantages in giving full effect to this
      Hat, which may be worn a little on one side, with a gentle inclination
      over the eyes, unless they are playing at cross purposes, in the event of
      which it must be thrown quite back, to give effect to their <i>playful
      humour</i>.

        THE REGENT.
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c013">
      A finely-formed and most decidedly elegant Hat: is somewhat upon a large
      scale, the crown being upwards of seven inches high, much yeoman, with an
      excellently turned and corresponding brim, producing together a happy
      union of the nicest proportions: It is worn to most advantage by persons
      whose height and bulk are above the common stature; not that it is meant
      to be understood, that every athletic or robust form would <i>become</i> a
      Regent; on the contrary, there is not a shape in the whole catalogue that
      demands in the wearer a greater share of <i>external requisites</i> than
      this; even the very <i>gait</i> is concerned, which, to strike, should be
      stately and firm, though easy, each step measuring exactly half the length
      of the whole body-more would become an absolute <i>stride</i>-and less a
      mere <i>strut</i>; than which nothing can be farther removed from graceful
      <i>carriage</i>: Be it understood, also, that the Regent is most becoming
      when placed a little on the <i>right</i> side, but by no means to come <i>within</i>
      half an inch of the ear-unless the latter should exceed its fair
      dimensions-in that case it were best hid altogether; but then, to do this,
      the Hat is forced beyond the proper position, and what was intended as
      ornament, becomes the very reverse: So circumstanced, the Noble Lord, the
      Shallow, or the John Bull, might be worn to most advantage; but when
      Nature has been a little attentive to the minuter parts, as well as the
      greater proportions of manly exterior, the Regent cannot fail to give
      additional dignity to the wearer; creating thereby a combination of
      elegancies that must render his appearance absolutely <span class="fss">IRRESISTIBLE</span>.

        THE KENT.
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c013">
      A very gentlemanly Hat, and although there is not the dignity of the
      Regent about it, there is, notwithstanding, much to admire: Indeed, the
      scale of proportions are very similar in both; the only <i>real</i>
      difference existing in the <i>crown</i>, which is about one-half of an
      inch lower than the latter; and, in the <i>nautical phraseology</i>, may
      not inaptly be termed a Regent cut down. It is very singular, and worth
      remarking, that trifling as the Kent differs from the Regent in actual
      measurement, the contrariety of effect, when on the head, is great and
      striking; which unquestionably proves, that a very slight deviation from a
      given rule will produce results more opposed to each other than the
      deviation is to the rule itself. The style in which this Hat should be
      worn is as follows:-if the head be of an <i>oval</i> form, place it
      thereon, as near as possible, in an horizontal position; but if a <i>round</i>
      head (which of all descriptions is most dreaded by a <i>castermonger</i>)
      let the Hat be thrown a <i>little</i> back, with a slight inclination on
      the side most agreeable, which will tend to prevent its assuming that <i>trencher</i>-like
      appearance too common from such causes. The <i>personal</i> requisites
      suitable to the Kent, may be found on referring to the Cobourg; with this
      difference, that, as the brim is of larger dimensions, the wearer, if he
      pleases, may be six feet high.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c013">
      A remarkably <span class="fss">STYLISH HAT</span>, possessing great and <i>peculiar</i>
      advantages over most others, on which account its claims to patronage are
      of the highest order. The brim, before as well as behind, being brought
      down quite square, and almost in a perpendicular line with the crown
      itself, gives the wearer an opportunity of observing things <i>en passant</i>,
      by a sort of side-glance, without being <i>seen</i> so to do; thus, it is
      well adapted for gentlemen who would fain indulge in the most exquisite
      admiration of the beauteous <i>fair</i>: but by reason of their extreme <i>modesty</i>,
      shrink from the trial: There is, also, another and a very important
      consideration, which cannot be allowed to pass unnoticed-it is a
      well-known truth, that there are certain situations in life where the
      falling into is not at all times to be avoided; the result of which is, to
      create in the imagination, a perpetual apprehension lest some villainous
      intruder should, in defiance of eloquence or inclination, <i>compel</i>
      the <i>acceptance</i> of his official or rather <i>officious</i>
      attendance: to counteract so dirty a custom, as well as to nip the system
      in the very <i>bud</i>, this Hat is most admirably contrived-for by a
      simple elevation of the hinder part, the front may be brought so far over
      the face, as to form a complete shade for the countenance. Here then is
      the attainment of two <i>great</i> ends-modesty encouraged, and
      impertinence restrained. Lastly, and not the least of its useful purposes
      is, that should the introduction of the Vis-a-Vis become general, those
      novel and graceful evolutions of the body, denominated the <i>bend</i>,
      the <i>flutter</i>, and the <i>poke</i>, may be performed in a much
      smaller space than usual, and without the least danger to the eyes, which
      is greatly to be feared, when the distinguished votaries, in the eager
      performance of these newly-imported civilities, are brought too abruptly
      <i>face to face</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      Although there is much of the <i>dash</i> in this Hat, it has,
      notwithstanding, a sort of <i>sombre</i> appearance, which calls on the
      wearer for a <i>figure</i> and <i>countenance</i> to correspond; it is
      therefore, if <i>ornamentally</i> considered, recommended to such only,
      whose complexion is of a darkish hue, visage long, not over bulky in
      person, and <i>above</i> the middle size; but, if <i>usefully</i>
      considered, all the nicer distinctions must yield to imperious necessity.

    <p class="c013">
      A connoisseur examining a fine painting, was asked by a bye-stander, which
      part he most admired; his answer was, "<i>no part</i>." "What!" observed
      the other, "is it possible that so highly talented a production as this is
      acknowledged to be, can have no merits in your estimation?" To which the
      connoisseur replied-"Sir, a work so masterly in execution-so striking in
      effect-so perfect in <i>all</i> its parts, cannot be truly estimated but
      as a <i>whole</i>." Here, then, the <i>picture</i> is the <i>Petersham</i>-the
      <i>selection</i> of beauties therein, the <i>difficulty</i>: To get rid of
      which, be it sufficient to state, that the prominent feature in this Hat
      is elegance of <i>style</i>, strongly visible in all its parts, and each
      part in unison with the whole; which for <i>tonish</i> and exquisite <i>dash</i>
      has no competitor. It will be seen, from what is here stated, that, much
      as this Hat is capable of transfusing its <i>graces</i> to the wearer (and
      who can doubt it), some <i>little</i> attention to <i>personal</i>
      requisites is necessary-which, in stature, should be over five feet seven,
      and not too lusty; countenance or complexion is of little consequence; but
      the visage should be oval, such corresponding uncommonly well with the
      fine <i>arched</i> brim, which forms nearly two-fifths of a circle; and,
      when tastefully placed on the head, with a slight inclination over the
      face, so as to bring the <i>fore</i> point on a line with the <i>tip</i>
      of the nose, such will be the result, that, whatever difficulty may attend
      a just description of its astonishing effects, the advantages to a wearer

      A very <span class="sc">contemplative, sedate, pious-looking Hat</span>,
      much worn by Police-Officers, Quack-Doctors, and Clergymen; this, it may
      be said, is a strange assemblage of <i>characters</i> to bring under <i>one
      head</i>, and some may hold the <i>association</i> to be a reflection on
      the <i>latter</i>, when in truth the very <i>opposite</i> is intended; in
      proof of which it is only necessary to observe that, where the attainment
      of an object depends on <i>outward show</i>, such contrivances will be
      resorted to as are best calculated to secure the object in view; and the
      very <i>assumption</i> of the habit here spoken of by the "traps" and
      "quacks" of the day, is evidence of the habit itself being in the <i>highest
      possible estimation</i>. If taken in an <i>ornamental</i> point of view,
      it would be no easy task to decide on its merits; but if <i>usefully</i>
      considered, the conclusion is plain and easy. It is an admitted fact, that
      an idea of dignity cannot embody itself with <i>little things</i>, hence
      the custom of wearing <i>large wigs</i>, for such doubtless these Hats
      were originally intended, and for this reason, the hinder part being drawn
      up with loops in two places, no peruke, however large its dimensions, can
      receive the least injury; in short, it may be worn under this Hat with as
      little discomfiture to the <i>intricate friz</i> as though it were
      absolutely on the very block itself: here then is produced what may be
      termed a happy union of wisdom and piety, inasmuch as it is allowed, when
      speaking of high legal characters, that the <i>wisdom</i> is in the <i>wig</i>,
      and by the same rule (when Clericus is worn by a Divine) the <i>piety</i>
      must be in the <i>Hat</i>. The style of putting on will greatly depend on
      the size of the <i>peruke</i>, without which it should never be worn,
      particularly if the hair be <i>lank and black</i>.

    <p class="c013">
      <span class="sc">This</span> is a Hat highly respectable in appearance,
      and well suited to gentlemen in the <i>decline</i> of life; but as that is
      a state to which few will acknowledge while there is a capability of <i>hobbling
      without a crutch</i>, something definite had better be stated by giving
      the precise age;-take it then at <i>fifty</i>, which will put all doubts
      at rest. The reason for fixing on the Baronet, as suitable to those in
      declining years, is its grave, reflecting, methodical cast, such as would
      seem to say of the <i>wearer</i>-"Here is one that possesses a serenity of
      mind, an easy indifference of disposition, a tranquillity of thought,
      which would quietly disentangle itself from the vain, shadowy, fleeting
      desires of this life, and leave no regret behind." There are many other
      recommendatory properties in this Hat, but those already particularized
      are the most valuable; yes, <i>valuable</i>,-for it is a well-known fact,
      that mankind are often made up of contrivance, that is, they frequently
      give to <i>appearance</i> the shape of <i>reality</i>;-and however strange
      the doctrine may at first appear, it is nevertheless true, that the custom
      is often attended with very <i>beneficial results</i>, inasmuch as by <i>endeavouring</i>
      to maintain an <i>apparent</i> consistency between <i>habit</i> and <i>action</i>,
      the <i>propriety</i> of doing right becomes so strongly impressed on the
      mind, that the villainy of a bad practice is seen in its <i>worst
      deformity</i>, and conscience, the unerring monitor of the mind, rides
      triumphant over all. These are recommendations of no ordinary nature, and
      such that will no doubt cause much inquiry after the <i>Baronet</i>. As to
      growth or countenance, there is an old saying, that "beggars should not be
      choosers;" and the wearer, if he becomes so from <i>necessity</i>, will
      feel the propriety of leaving choice out of the question.

      A mind which is struck, through the medium of sight, with impressions of
      sublimity, will have those impressions strengthened in proportion as the
      <i>magnitude</i> of the object viewed is the greater, and as all things
      are but great or small <i>comparatively</i>, it follows, of course, that
      bodies of the same class, description, or affinity, which are <i>less</i>
      than the <i>largest</i>, must suffer, when brought into the scale of
      comparison with their superiors: agreeably to these rules, the <span
      class="sc">Jolliffe</span>, whose dimensions exceed all others, comes
      forward with strong claims to patronage, for besides the importance with
      which it never fails to strike every beholder, it is sure to convey a
      corresponding importance to the <span class="fss">WEARER</span>. Here then
      are considerations which should not be trifled with, particularly as the
      <i>assumption</i> of a thing is often taken for the thing itself-nay, are
      there not situations in life where <i>appearances</i> become so vitally
      important that it would be little short of criminality not to <i>put them
      on</i>? and where the attainment of great ends may be insured by nothing
      more than a simple attention to the <i>formation</i> of a <i>Hat</i>, it
      would be worse than folly to neglect the means. Rightly taken, what a
      multiplicity of persons might be benefitted by the above <i>hints</i>;
      Princes, Peers, and Plenipotentiaries; Senators, State-ministers, or
      Trading Politicians;-all-all may find their interest in the adoption of
      the Jolliffe; and that these great personages may not plead ignorance as
      to the manner in which it should be worn with the best effect, here follow
      the proper instructions.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      If a <span class="sc">Prince</span>, let it be <i>lightly</i> placed on
      the head, and a little <i>aside</i>, which <i>bespeaks a sort of cheerful
      approving</i> confidence in one's own actions.-If a <span class="sc">Peer</span>,
      it should be worn in a firm horizontal position, just covering half the
      forehead; which gives the appearance of a wise and steady determination
      where great questions are agitated, particularly when they become <i>self</i>
      interesting.-If an <span class="sc">Ambassador</span>, it may be thrown a
      <i>little back</i>, inclining somewhat aside; such position indicating a
      bold and careless indifference to all around, which will be taken for
      granted that such could not arise from any other cause than a total
      disregard for the <i>result</i> of his mission; a practice, although not
      often hit on, may have many advantages. As to the three <i>latter</i>
      characters, their pursuits having all the same end-<span class="fss">POPULARITY</span>-let

        A BIT OF BLOOD.
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c013">
      The term itself naturally implies a something upon a <i>small</i> scale,
      which is the fact, and although there is nothing of that imposing dignity
      of style in the above Hat, which characterizes the <i>Regent</i>, the <i>Petersham</i>,
      &amp;c. there is a <i>lively</i>, <i>animated</i>, and <i>vigorous</i>
      fire in all its features, that will not allow of any falling off in the
      general comparison. To give a complete catalogue of the many <span
      class="fss">VIRTUES</span> belonging to <i>a bit of blood</i>, would
      exceed the allotted limits; but it cannot be amiss to detail a few of the
      more <i>prominent</i>, that all, whose necessities may bear to the point,
      should be <i>benefitted</i> by the <i>wearing</i>: First then, it is
      admirably calculated for those who are about to ask <i>favors</i>, such
      being more readily <i>granted</i> when they seem the <i>less wanted</i>,
      and no one could suppose that the <i>saucy</i> animation which would be so
      strongly visible under this Hat could make the application from <span
      class="fss">NECESSITY</span>. Secondly, it will be of singular advantage
      to <i>elderly gentlemen</i> in pursuit of <i>young wives</i>, who nine
      times in ten decide on the choice of a man from the <i>cock</i>-of his
      Hat. Thirdly, (not that there is much need of it for such a purpose
      now-a-days) its advantages for those that are tormented with <i>dunns</i>
      are incalculable, for, by being placed pretty firm on the head, inclining
      rather to one side, at the same time assuming a sharp <i>erect</i>
      position of the body, a stern direction of the eye, and arms <i>a-kimbo</i>,
      the devil himself, in the shape of a <i>creditor</i>, would hardly hazard
      the <span class="fss">REPETITION OF A VISIT</span>.

    <p class="c013">
      <span class="sc">Turks</span> are said to assign as a reason for not
      wearing Hats, that they are put together by <i>witchcraft</i>. There is
      certainly a great deal of ingenuity in the practice, and some <i>effects</i>
      produced whose <i>causes</i> are as yet unexplained: but, with all due
      deference to these <i>turban gentlemen</i>, it is presumed that they have
      objections beyond what is above stated, some of which are as follows:-<i>First</i>,
      their country is destitute of the most essential material-<span class="fss">FUR</span>.
      <i>Second</i>, the climate being extremely sultry, stoves, irons, and
      scalding water are not likely to become favourites. <i>Thirdly</i>, being
      compelled by their religion to keep their heads <i>close shaved</i>, a
      Hat, above all human inventions, would be the most ridiculous covering <i>they</i>
      could adopt.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      There are many opinions as to the time Hats were first invented, and, very
      probably, all equally erroneous. Some carry the date as far back as the
      foundation of Christianity, attributing the merit to St. Luke, of whom it
      is said, that he, having tender feet, put a layer of hair or fur between
      them and his sandals, in which situation friction and moisture caused such
      an interweaving of particles, that the whole became strongly united, or
      (technically called) <span class="fss">FELTED</span>. Whether the story,
      as applied to Luke, be true or false, is immaterial; but that such did
      happen with some one, is very likely; nor is it at all unlikely, but that
      an occurrence of this kind did really give the first idea of Hat-making.
      Having remarked thus much, I shall next proceed to state, what is not the
      less true than surprising, which is, that of the various branches of
      manufacture which this country is so highly distinguished for, none are
      less understood than Hat-making; nay, there is not one person in fifty
      who, if he were asked the question, could tell whether a Hat was or was
      not a <i>woven</i> substance; nor is there one in 500 but what suppose
      that the <i>skin</i> of a hare or rabbit is worked with the fur <i>attached</i>
      to it, as in the natural state; and, to form a correct judgment of the
      external material, when manufactured, whether it be hair, wool, or beaver,
      although many pretend, none are really competent but those <i>experienced</i>
      in the <i>trade</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      To show the absurd notions some entertain on this matter, I state as a
      fact, that I do not know a manufacturer or seller in the trade but what
      has been applied to, by some one or other, to have a <i>Beaver</i> Hat
      made from a <i>hare</i>'s skin. Nay, I remember once offending a very good
      customer, and a man not wanting for sense either, by an involuntary burst
      of laughter, on his presenting the skin of a <i>French lap-dog</i> for the
      very same purpose.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      It is no uncommon thing for persons who are on pretty good terms with
      their capabilities to give opinions as to the <i>merits</i> or <i>demerits</i>
      of a Hat; which opinions are as opposite to the true state of the case as
      the sun's rays to a state of darkness. I shall give an instance, although
      a trifling one, of a very common error among persons who <i>suppose</i>
      themselves to have a knowledge of the subject, which is this, if the
      picker has not a very good eye, some of the larger hairs will be left in
      the Hat, and consequently the most <i>visible</i>; these are directly
      termed "<i>grey hairs</i>," when the truth is, that they are the <i>blackest</i>
      in the whole composition; but being thicker than the general mass, they
      receive a greater portion of <i>light</i>, which is mistaken for a grey
      colour: an easy method of proving the fact is to pull one of these <i>grey
      hairs</i> from the Hat, and place it on a piece of white paper, the <i>contrast</i>
      will decide the question.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      Again, whatever produces a glutinization of the <span class="fss">NAP</span>,
      is said to be the effect of the stiffening; this is not true in every
      case, for it is frequently owing to improper management in placing the
      Hat, when wet, before a large fire, which should never be done; the better
      way is, if very wet, to hang it up without brushing or wiping, and when
      dry it is easily put to rights, by gently passing over a clothes brush: if
      only slightly wet, wipe it with a handkerchief, and, when dry, it will
      brush clean. But the great fault with most persons is to put on their
      Hats, day after day, in the same <i>dirty state</i> as when taken off at
      night; from which it is natural to infer, that there must be a vast
      accumulation of dirt; it is this dirt, when exposed to the rain, that
      forms a sort of cement, or paste, having all the appearance of what is
      commonly called "<i>gum</i>."
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      Another proof of erroneous judgment-Profuse perspiration of the head is
      what many are subject to; by reason of which, from the frequency of
      wearing, and the <i>porosity</i> of the Hat, there is a continual
      absorption of moisture going on until it becomes completely <i>saturated</i>,
      particularly in front, the consequence is, that the nap lies buried in a
      greasy matter, which matter is also, but very inappropriately termed <i>gum</i>
      or <i>stiffening</i>, when in point of fact it is <i>neither</i>, for the
      very same effect would, under the like circumstances, be produced, and in
      much less time, if the Hat were not stiffened at all. The best remedy for
      this is a piece of thin flannel under the leather, and that frequently
      changed.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      There is nothing so detrimental to a Hat as a severe exposure to rain on
      the first, second, or even third time of wearing; for this reason, the
      materials wherewith it is composed are in a manner quite <i>green</i>, and
      require <i>seasoning</i>; to effect which it should be frequently put on
      in dry weather. I have always found that a Hat, constantly worn for five
      or six weeks <i>without being wet</i>, underwent every sort of hardship
      afterwards with little or no injury, retaining at the same time its
      beauty-form-and wearing <i>three times longer</i> than it otherwise would
      have done. It may be asked, why not, to prevent accidents, render the Hat
      <i>water-proof</i>? that is, impervious to the action of either atmosphere
      or rain. The thing is easy enough, I admit; but where there is a choice of
      only <i>two evils</i>, it is always best to select the <i>least</i>. We
      all know (or should know) that if a man were to enclose himself, arms,
      legs, and body, in what is called an <i>oil-skin dress</i>, and that drawn
      close round the neck, the whole tightly fitted to every part of his person
      as a Hat is to the head, the most unpleasant consequences would ensue; the
      cause why is obviously this, the exhalations of the body, particularly in
      a state of exertion, would when so <i>enclosed</i>, be either prevented
      from flying off, as nature requires, or otherwise checked altogether;
      precisely so with the head if the porosity of the Hat was destroyed, which
      it must be to resist effectually the action of water. This deduction must
      be so clear and self-evident that further reasoning is unnecessary.
      Another great objection against water-proof <i>Hats</i> is, that the
      ingredients made use of for such purposes, when exposed to the sun's heat,
      are so acted upon as to cause a <i>decomposition</i> of the colour, and
      nine times in ten, the Hat, before it is half worn out, becomes any thing
      but what it was meant to be.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      It is astonishing to hear the number of qualifications a Hat is <i>said</i>
      to have, and each as opposite to the other as it is possible for any two
      things to be; some, for instance, maintain that it cannot be good unless
      it is <i>light</i>, others again will decidedly condemn it for <i>being so</i>,
      insisting that the chief recommendation is its being firm and <i>stout</i>.
      All that is requisite to be observed on this, is that <i>weight</i> has no
      more to do with the <i>quality</i> of a Hat, than the situation of prime
      minister has to do with the cramming of turkies. A very inferior Hat may
      be made <i>equally light</i> with the most superior, and in both cases the
      cost of manufacture will be less than if they were made <i>stout</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      The length of the beaver too is another point on which the difference of
      opinion is often experienced; many are for very <i>short naps</i>,
      declaring all others to be outrageously vulgar; but the majority of
      wearers seem best pleased with <i>long</i> naps, which always <i>take</i>
      and <i>retain</i> the best <i>black</i>, while, on the contrary those that
      are very short never do. A medium between the two is the most preferable.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      Having stated thus much, I shall next proceed to explain in what way a
      fine Hat is <i>made</i>, describing as accurately as possible the various
      processes it undergoes, as also the materials with which it is composed,
      the proportions of each as well as the quantity of work a man is capable
      of doing, whether <i>maker</i> or <i>finisher</i>, in a week, the amount
      of wages, together with some of the curious regulations, by-laws, &amp;c.
      &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      In the first place, as I shall have occasion to mention a few of the <i>implements</i>
      by name, a short description of them may not be amiss.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      There is the <span class="fss">BOW</span>, which in form is not unlike
      what is used for playing on a <i>double bass</i>, but in length and
      thickness is equal to a constable's staff; there is a bridge at each end,
      from one to the other of which is tightly strung a stout line of <i>catgut</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      The <span class="fss">HURDLE</span> is situate in what is called the bow
      garret, and is a sort of <i>table</i>, on which the <i>fur</i> is bowed,
      or mixed, having the farther end and sides enclosed to prevent the
      material from being blown away.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      The <span class="fss">BATTERY</span> is somewhat like the hopper of a
      mill, in this is contained the hot <i>liquor</i>, and is mostly
      constructed for eight men, <i>round</i> which they stand when <i>making</i>;
      the lower part is lead, the upper or working part mahogany. All batteries
      are formed into divisions called <span class="fss">PLANKS</span>, one of
      which is allotted to each man. There are many other little things used by
      makers, but these three are all that deserve particular notice.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      The first thing a maker looks for in the morning is the <span class="fss">FUR</span>,
      or raw material, which is furnished to him by <i>weight</i>; the quantity
      being more or less, according to the substance of the Hat required, and is
      in <i>two</i> parcels, one of which contains the <span class="fss">BEAVER</span>,
      or napping; the other the <span class="fss">BODY</span> (a proportionate
      scale of both will be seen hereafter). Thus provided he takes it to the
      <span class="fss">BOW GARRET</span>; the materials for the body are first
      placed on the hurdle, and the bow being hung at the centre for support, is
      held in the left hand horizontally, so that the catgut may come in contact
      with the fur; in the <i>right</i> hand is placed a small piece of stick,
      with a <i>nut</i> at the end, and in this position the work begins after
      the following manner. The <i>catgut</i> of the bow (being first placed in
      the midst of the <i>fur</i>) is pulled or struck with the knotted stick,
      which produces, from a quick repetition of the stroke, a continued <i>vibration</i>,
      this <i>vibration</i> it is that causes a separation or <i>flitting</i> of
      the fur, at the same time mixing and cleansing it. This operation is
      continued until such ends are fully attained. It is next divided into <i>halves</i>,
      one of which is laid aside, and the other again bowed over. In this second
      operation the workman contrives, partly by bowing, and partly by a slight
      <i>wicker frame</i>, to bring the material into an oblong form, and equal
      in size to a large sheet of cartridge paper; this is called a <span
      class="fss">BAT</span>, and when done it is gently <i>pressed down</i> by
      the <i>wicker</i>, after which a damp linen cloth is laid all over, and on
      this again is placed a thick piece of dry <span class="fss">HORSE HIDE</span>;
      the workman now begins to press hard on the hide for about five minutes;
      in the doing this the fur adheres close to the damp cloth, into which it
      is <i>doubled up</i>, and once more undergoes the pressure of the hand.
      Under this operation (which is called <span class="fss">BASONING</span>)
      the <i>bat</i> becomes <i>consolidated</i>, and may be thrown, when taken
      out of the cloth, from one end of the garret to the other without injury.
      The second half is next bowed, formed into a <i>bat</i>, and <i>basoned</i>
      as the first. This half <i>remains</i> on <i>the hurdle</i>, and a piece
      of <i>paper</i>, somewhat conical, is placed on it, <i>over which</i>, and
      agreeable to the shape, the sides of the bat are <i>doubled</i>. Here then
      is formed one half of the <i>body</i>, this is laid aside, and the first
      bat is then put flat on the hurdle <i>on which</i> the one previously
      doubled is placed with its open part downwards; the lower bat being
      transversely doubled over the top hat, forms a sort of conical, or
      harlequin's cap; in this state it is once more put into the damp cloth,
      where it receives another hardening for the purpose of uniting or <i>knitting</i>
      both <i>bats</i> together; after this it is folded into the compass of <i>two
      hands</i>, ready for the <i>plank</i>. The next thing is the <i>beaver</i>,
      or covering, which is bowed in <i>form</i> to correspond with the <i>body</i>,
      but has nothing to do with it in this stage.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      Matters being completed thus far, this is called the <i>first process of
      Hat-making</i>. The second commences as follows:-The workman having gone
      from the bow garret to the making shop, takes his stand at the battery,
      under which is a <span class="fss">FIRE</span>, for the purpose of heating
      the liquor;<a id="r1"></a><a href="#f1" class="c018"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
      into this hot liquor the <i>body</i> is quickly <i>immersed</i>, where it
      remains till soaked through; it is afterwards laid on the <i>plank</i> to
      <i>drain</i> and <i>cool</i>; this done, it is unfolded, gently rolled,
      turned at short intervals in every direction, to prevent the sides uniting
      together; and as the <i>liquor</i> becomes <i>cold</i> and rolled out, it
      is continually supplied with <i>hot</i> and fresh, by the sprinkling of a
      <i>brush</i>, which is dipped in the <i>kettle</i> for that purpose; under
      this operation, assisted by the astringency of the <i>vitriol</i>, the
      body <i>shrinks</i>, and begins to assume a tough <i>substance</i>. When
      it has shrunk to a <i>certain size</i> (say three-fifths, if to be <i>double</i>
      covered), it is laid flat on the <i>plank</i>, and the <i>first</i> coat
      of <i>beaver</i>, as it comes from the <i>bow</i>, is laid quite over it;
      the <i>brush</i> is now dipped into the hot liquor, the contents of which
      is sprinkled all over the <i>beaver</i>, directly afterwards it is gently
      <i>patted down</i> with the hot brush; here the body is put into a <i>hair-cloth</i>,
      rolled in hot liquor, turned inside out, rolled again until the <i>beaver</i>,
      is completely worked into the body; when this is effected, it is in a fit
      state to receive the <i>second</i> covering, which is put on as the first,
      the <i>working</i>, <i>turning</i>, <i>patting</i>, and <i>rolling</i>
      still continuing until it is reduced to a fit dimension, the <i>beaver</i>
      quite <i>clean</i>, and all together assuming a closely <i>felted</i>,
      fine, solid piece of workmanship; after which it is immediately <i>blocked</i>
      in this same liquor, to the size wanted, and put into a <i>stove</i> to
      dry, from whence it is taken, and with a small fine card the beaver is
      gently raised; without this, one half would lie buried, and the beauty
      lost.-Here then is the complete <span class="fss">PROCESS OF HAT-MAKING</span>.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote c019" id="f1">
      <p class="c020">
        <span class="label"><a href="#r1">1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The liquor,
        which is always kept up to <i>scalding</i> heat, is nothing more than
        clean soft water, with a wine glass of <i>vitriol</i>, and a small
        quantity of beer dregs thrown in. The first is to <i>shrink</i> the body
        of the Hat in working; the other to destroy the <i>pernicious</i> effect
        of the vitriol.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="c011">
      It is next sent to the <span class="fss">DYER</span> from whom it passes
      to the <span class="fss">FINISHER</span>, who, after stiffening, blocking,
      and <i>half</i> finishing, sends it to be picked, which is performed by a
      woman, whose place it is to pull out the <i>kemps</i> or thick hairs,
      without injuring the beaver,<a id="r2"></a><a href="#f2" class="c018"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
      although that is not always accomplished. From the <i>picker</i> it
      returns to the finisher who, by the <span class="fss">IRON</span> and
      velvet cushion, gives it those highly brilliant and admired beauties that
      an English Hat is so pre-eminently distinguished for. The shaper next
      takes it in hand, who is guided in his operations by the <i>fancy</i> of
      the wearer, if bespoke, which is sometimes a little <i>whimsical</i>.
      After shaping, it goes to the <i>trimmer</i>, from whom it is returned to
      the <span class="fss">TIPPER OFF</span>; he gets it ready for wearing; it
      is then sent to its destination, when the master, if he is <i>fortunate</i>,

      <span class="sc">To</span> enter <i>fully</i> into the various regulations
      and forms that the "<i>trade</i>" have, from time to time, instituted and
      acted upon, would of itself fill a volume; all that can be done then in
      this small work will be to give the best possible outline of such matters
      as are most likely to interest those who may wish for information on the
      subject. The most important laws of this trade are these:-
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      <i>First</i>-No man shall work as a <i>maker</i> or <i>finisher</i>,
      unless he has served an apprenticeship of seven years to what is called a
      "<i>fair master</i>."
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      <i>Second</i>-To be a fair master, and entitled, according to the rules of
      the trade, to take an apprentice, he must have manufactured his <i>own
      Hats</i>, seven years prior to the <i>taking</i>, or otherwise have served
      a fair seven years' apprenticeship himself to the trade.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      <i>Third</i>-Whether there be one, two, or more in a manufacturing firm,
      that firm are not to have more than two apprentices at one time.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      <i>Fourth</i>-There are a number of masters who do not manufacture their
      own "<i>stuff</i>," but are employed by "<i>Great Houses</i>," who,
      although they have a right, by law, to take apprentices, yet those
      apprentices, by reason of their masters not working their <i>own materials</i>,
      are never admitted to stand by the side of <i>fair men</i>, on which
      account they must ever continue <i>foul</i>, and debarred of the usual
      privileges, or submit to a <i>second</i> apprenticeship. This is a case
      that frequently occurs; indeed it is no uncommon thing to see a man with a
      wife and half a dozen children, himself near thirty years old, serving a
      second apprenticeship for a fair time; the hardship of this must be
      admitted, inasmuch as it is punishing a man for a fault he never
      committed.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      <i>Fifth</i>-A <i>foul man</i> is one that has not served his
      apprenticeship agreeably to the rule of the trade, or has been guilty of
      some act detrimental to the <i>supposed</i> interests of the journeymen in
      general. These are called "<span class="fss">KNOBSTICKS</span>."
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      <i>Sixth</i>-A fair man has the privilege of what is called "<i>turns upon
      tramp</i>," that is, if he cannot obtain work in the town where he
      resides, or has an inclination to <i>travel</i>, he may journey or <i>tramp</i>
      to the next; should any of the <i>fraternity</i> be there, and he wishes
      to get "<i>shopped</i>" he is "<i>asked for</i>" by one in that factory,
      (no man being allowed to ask for himself), if unsuccessful, there are two
      night's lodging for him, two pots of strong beer, bread and cheese, and a
      shilling or two to forward him to the next town. The <i>money turn</i> in
      London is five shillings, but no man is entitled to a <i>second</i> turn
      in one place, until after the expiration of six months from his receiving
      the first.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      <i>Seventh</i>-If a journeyman has, by his own act, become <i>foul</i>,
      nothing can absolve him but submitting to a <i>fine</i>, and this is
      measured according to the offence, which, in some <i>heinous</i> cases,
      such as "<i>creeping</i>" into favour with the master, or going to work
      when all the rest have struck for wages, is as high as ten guineas.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      There are three distinct courts for the examination and punishment of
      offenders. The <i>first</i>, or High Court of <span class="sc">Congress</span>,
      is a sort of general assembly, composed of either Makers or Finishers,
      just as their separate interests may be concerned; but on all joint
      questions these parties form a <i>junction</i>. In this court matters of
      importance only are discussed; as, for instance, the <i>advance of prices</i>,
      the abrogation of old laws, and the making of new ones, under the <i>operation</i>
      of which, it sometimes happens that both men and masters, as well as the
      law of the land, are alike the victims. The <i>fines</i> levied in this
      court are appropriated to special and "<span class="fss">STRIKING</span>"
      purposes, often tending to produce a "<span class="fss">COMBINATION</span>"
      of interesting effects. The masters too are not wholly exempt from these
      pretty little combinations, which, however, do not always realize or carry
      their intended <i>point</i>; this is owing (it is thought) to the vast
      affection journeymen bear towards their employers; indeed so much so, that
      they cannot bear the <i>latter</i> should "<span class="fss">LOWER</span>"
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      There is a court below this, which is formed by taking one or two men from
      the seven <i>nearest</i> shops. Their sitting, if not <i>public</i>, is
      sure to be in a <i>public-house</i>, president, <i>Sir John Barleycorn</i>.
      The matters chiefly brought here are those that relate to the misconduct
      of journeymen towards each other in the same factory, and which cannot be
      settled where they originated. This is called "<span class="fss">DOZENING</span>,"
      and their power of <span class="fss">FINE</span> extends to two guineas,
      which is drank in good old stout by the whole seven shops; but as all <i>dry</i>
      subjects are prohibited in this tribune, the extent of fine greatly
      depends on the state of the weather; so that if it be a sultry summer's
      day, the punishment of an offender is in proportion to the <i>sun's heat</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      The third and lowest <i>court</i> is an assembly of shop-mates only, this
      meeting is called a "<span class="fss">GARRET MATCH</span>," and may be
      demanded for the punishment of an aggressor, by any aggrieved man in a
      factory. Power of fine from two to ten shillings.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      I have before stated that there are in this trade <i>foul</i> men; in
      point of number they constitute about one-sixth part of the whole; but
      their earnings, or price of labour is the same as the fair trade.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      A journeyman finisher in full work will earn, on an average, from three to
      four pounds a-week; while, on the contrary, a maker cannot get more than
      <i>fifty shillings</i>. This is a subject of much jealousy and discontent;
      nor is it likely to be otherwise, unless the latter can raise himself to
      an equality with the former; against this there are many obstacles, one of
      which is, the <i>increasing</i> foul trade, who would continue working,
      even though the fair men had "<i>struck</i>." Another is, that they could
      never obtain the co-operation of the finishers, who, being amply paid
      themselves, think it best to leave well alone.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      These are the <i>principal regulations</i> which govern journeymen
      hatters, whether they have a good or a bad tendency is questionable; there
      are many in the <i>trade</i> who decidedly condemn them, giving as their
      reasons, that they encourage idleness, tippling, and endless squabbles. <i>Idleness</i>-inasmuch
      as when men are summoned to discuss the most trifling matters, even though
      the meeting be at five o'clock in the morning, they seldom feel <i>disposed</i>
      to return to their work that day. <i>Tippling</i>-for the reason that, as
      <i>fines</i> are mostly spent in <i>drink</i>, the conviction of a
      supposed offender is generally <i>thirsted</i> after; but as the quantum
      levied seldom suffices, all further supplies for the remainder of the day
      are met by individual subscription. In these cases there is no show of
      niggardliness, as every succeeding gallon of the "<i>sparkling entire</i>,"
      is but an <i>internal</i> messenger, bearing the glad tidings of another
      to come. <i>Squabbles</i>, because it is natural, when the <i>desire</i>
      for a thing is once created, and the gratification of that desire (where
      nothing of criminality attaches) can be indulged, by having recourse to a
      little contrivance, that the opportunity of so doing should be more
      frequently <i>made</i>, than suffered to approach accidentally; which will
      account for the <i>trifling magnitudes</i> that are allowed to agitate
      shops and factories in general. The arguments in <i>favour</i> of these
      laws are, that without them, apprentices would be careless in serving out
      their <i>time</i>, the trade over-run with bad workmen, hats greatly
      deteriorated in the manufacture, the excellence of which is their chief
      recommendation in a foreign market, and the surest guarantee of the
      master's profits at home.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      Having given the <i>contending</i> opinions, in reference to the laws of
      this trade, I shall say a word or two concerning the shape, and manner of
      placing a hat on the head.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c013">
      <span class="sc">There</span> is no part of a man's dress that <i>makes</i>
      or <i>mars</i> his appearance so much as his hat; not that it is its
      striking beauty when new, or a want of it when old, that is most
      materially concerned in producing either of the above effects; the grand
      point is the <span class="sc">form</span>, and the position which it is
      made to assume on the head; yet how few there are who give the least
      attention to either, except indeed military men, and they in general are
      uncommonly tasty, affording the best example of the precise style in which
      a hat should be worn. It is no less singular than true, that the same hat,
      by being placed on the head in different positions, will give, in <i>appearance</i>,
      as many distinct <i>characters</i> to the <i>same person</i> as the number
      of those positions amount to. The most striking are as follows:-<i>sullenness</i>-<i>indolence</i>-<i>gravity</i>,
      and <i>good humoured impudence</i>. To give the first, draw the brim of
      the hat so far over the eyes that they shall be quite concealed. The
      second is produced by the hat being thrown quite back. The third by a prim
      <i>horizontal</i> set, covering equally all parts of the head; and the
      fourth will not be easily mistaken wherever an <i>extravagant cock</i> on
      either side is brought full into view. These are undoubtedly all <i>extreme</i>
      habits, and seldom pushed to the extent here described; yet a slight
      inclination to either position may, under circumstances, have a very good
      effect.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      There is another bad custom that ought to be noticed, which I shall do by
      first observing, that a hat was intended solely to keep the head <i>dry</i>-<span
      class="fss">ON</span> which it should be worn; but many seem to differ
      from this opinion, using it as a sort of <span class="fss">NIGHT-CAP</span>
      wherein is thrust head, ears, and all. This is a most slovenly practice,
      as well as a dangerous one, inasmuch as it tends to keep the head in a
      continual and <i>forced</i> state of perspiration, rendering a liability
      to "<i>take cold</i>," every time the hat is removed. Yet even this habit
      is not so bad as sticking the hat on the <i>back</i> of the head, which,
      of all others, is the most general, and carries with it the greatest
      impropriety, because such a position not only destroys the shape, but by
      lodging on the coat collar, the hind part, from <i>friction</i>, becomes
      greasy, and the binding is always in a state of raggedness; added to these
      disadvantages, a most ridiculous effect is produced by the practice, that
      is, the head in <i>appearance</i> is converted into a sort of <i>peg</i>,
      <span class="fss">AGAINST</span> which the hat seems to <i>hang</i>,
      instead of being placed <i>upon</i>. A man who indulges in so bad a
      custom, should at least preserve a <i>consistency</i> in his dress by
      walking "slip shoed," breeches knees open, and without braces, stockings
      down, waistcoat unbuttoned, cravat half tied, one arm only in his coat
      sleeve, and at least a six months' uncombed crop of hair about his
      pericranium; here he would be of a piece; and grotesque as such a figure
      must appear, by a general adoption of these "captivating negligencies,"
      there is no greater inconsistency in the whole catalogue than that of
      wearing a hat on the <i>back part</i> of the head.
    </p>
    <p class="c011">
      As to the <i>form</i> of a hat, and what is best for <i>this face</i> or
      <i>that person</i>, there is more in it than what is generally supposed,
      and a great deal might be said on the subject; but to talk of a <i>standard
      fashion</i> is absurd in the extreme, in proof of which it need only be
      observed, that if very large hats were adopted, a thin man of five feet
      high, would, by the wearing, become as complete a caricature, as a twenty
      stone man of six feet would by wearing a very small one. The best fashion
      a man can follow in a hat is that which best becomes him, and various as
      heads, faces, and persons may be, all things are now accomplished (so far
      as a hat is concerned) that can either <i>fit</i> the one or ornament the
      other,

        <span class="label"><a href="#r4">4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>No hat can be
        good, or well covered, with less than one ounce of prime beaver; and,
        small as the quantity is, there was a time when journeymen makers
        (catching the custom of their betters, and by way of tythe) thought it
        no sin to appropriate a part of this material to their <i>own use</i>;
        but, for the credit of the <i>trade</i> be it said, the practice is long
        since abolished, and a man attempting it at the present day would be
        scouted from the factory where he worked, by every honest journeyman
        therein.

        week's work of a <i>maker</i> is about ten hats; that of a <i>finisher</i>,
        from five to six dozen.

    <p class="c011">
      Such is the cost of materials and labour at the present period; it is true
      that the above scale is drawn from "credit prices;" but let every part of
      a manufacturing concern be carried on for money only, which is rarely the
      case, still the deduction from the <i>whole</i> cannot be more than 7½ per
      cent. All substitutes for the above <i>materials</i> are decidedly
      condemned; nor can their <i>quantities</i>, as here stated, be lessened,
      without injury to the remainder. Here then is sufficient evidence that a
      fine hat must, under the most favourable circumstances, stand the
      manufacturer in upwards of twenty-one shillings, yet many <i>assume</i> a
      capability of <i>retailing</i> such an article at less even than the
      charge of manufacture.

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
